HTML5! Up - Directive theme for Drupal 8 Twig

[HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net) theme [Directive](http://html5up.net/directive) ported to Drupal 8. Markup altered to fit Drupal data rendering and dropped IE8 support due to the [end of official Windows IE8 support and its lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle#gp/msl-ie-dotnet-an).


## Some notes
 + Dropped IE8 support of original Directive theme
 + Splitted main.css into parts (Skel, grid,etc.)
 + Please use tags (terms) to alter the fa-icon names for the hover effects or the frontpage images
 + Due to Drupals architecture the one-page layout of the original theme needs some content administration to look good.
